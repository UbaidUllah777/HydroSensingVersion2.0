        paragraph: `Pakistan is under severe flood in the month of August, especially the last few days.
           Today (August 26, 2022) Kabul river, Guddu and Sukkur barrages have been through a high
            flood situation. The adjoining areas are almost washed by floods in the past few days.
            The situation is shown in the picture where the flow in the rivers is categorized into the
            low flow (sky blue dots), normal flow (green dots), medium flood (blue dots),
            high flood (orange dots), very high flood (brown dots), and exceptionally high floods
            (red dots). The river branches are also coloured the same as discussed above.
            The flood has caused havoc in Swat valley (Swat River) and Dir (Panjkora River).
            The flood recorded in Swat Valley is 227,000 cusecs which are far higher than the previous
             flood in 2010 (175,000 cusecs). Currently, the Kabul River has a very high flood of about
              154,000 cusecs passing through the Kabul bridge. Similarly, the Taunsa barrage
               recorded 505, 989 cusecs, the Guddu barrage reported 505,048 cusecs, and Sukkur
                has 575,441 cusecs of outflow. The flood at those stations can be classified
                as high to exceptionally high floods.`,

            on the same day. The previous five and ten-year average flow at the stations was
             301,700 cusecs and 302,400 cusecs, respectively. Tarbela dam has reached its full
             capacity, where total storage of 9.075 MAF was reported to date, which was 10.022
             MAF last year on the same day. The previous five and ten-year averages were 10.991

           However, extreme climate changes at local and
          regional scales, drastic land-cover alterations, rapid population growth, rapid 
          urbanization, increasing economic development, and unprecedented technological innovations
           have led to a global water supply crisis (Johnson et al., 2001). It is roughly estimated
           that more than 2 billion people globally have no access to safe drinking water, and another
           4 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation services. There is a significant
            increase in water-borne diseases, which lead to 250 million different kinds of diseases
            (Gleick et al., 2012; Water, 2016). One of the dominant factors of such a rapid
             increase in water-borne diseases is wastewater discharge into flowing water in oceans,
              rivers, and streams. More than 80% of industrial and municipal wastewater is
               discharged into rivers or oceans without any treatment, leading to 800,000 deaths
                in 2012 alone and negatively impacting fisheries, livelihoods, and food chains
                 (WWAP, 2017).`,

        clean and safe drinking water, poor water infrastructure and sanitation, polluted water,
        and low level of water security (Jayaswal et al., 2018). In developing countries,
         more than a billion people don’t have enough access to clean water (Simanis, 2011).
          These issues are exacerbated by poor government policies to mitigate the impacts
           of climate change, especially extreme weather changes like drought and floods.
           The developing countries have limited resources and thus end up with severe
            water crises, including depleted groundwater and surface water resources and
            lower water quality.`,

        paragraph: `Considering Pakistan as an example from the list of developing countries,
         water scarcity has already become a petrifying reality, along with other environmental
          issues linked with climate change and the highly erratic nature of rainfall. In Pakistan,
           more than 21 million out of 207 million people had no access to clean water a few years
           ago (Zulfiqar, 2018). Studies have revealed that besides poor water management practices,
            the environment and climate change significantly contribute to Pakistan’s depleting 
            water resources (Rahman et al., 2022). The water supply and demand gap are getting
             bigger and bigger with the passage of time, where climate change, rapid increase 
             in population, lack of political will, limited scientific solutions, lack of
              water conservation structures and practices, and most importantly, the lack 
              of awareness among the general public play a critical role in water crises
               (Zhang et al., 2020). In this article, we will study the detailed comparison
                of water resources between Pakistan, China, and the United States (US). Then
                we will discuss the factors involved in the water crises and how we can tackle
                these factors to manage water resources efficiently, keeping in view the examples
                 from China and US.`,
      },

      {
        paragraph: `Comparison of Water Resources between Pakistan, China, and US
        Based on the AQUASTAT data of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
         the freshwater resources in Pakistan, China, and US are 259.15 billion m3,
          2,005.26 billion m3, and 8,622 billion m3, respectively. Pakistan, China,
           and US have different geographies, climates, and socio-economic systems,
            yet all three struggle with uneven distribution of water resources. 
            According to the Ministry of Water Resources of China, agriculture is
             the most water-intensive sector in China, accounting for 74.6% of 
             freshwater consumption, followed by industrial use with a 20%-23% consumption
              rate. According to the US Geological Survey, agriculture is the second largest 
              consumer of groundwater and surface water in US, accounting for 42% of the total 
              freshwater withdrawal in 2015, whereas industrial use is 46%. On the other hand,
               Pakistan consumes approximately 94% of total available surface and groundwater 
               resources in the agriculture sector, resulting in extreme difficulties
                in managing water resources in terms of quality and quantity.The statistics
                reveal that agriculture is the main consumer of water in Pakistan. Yet,
                 we are not self-sufficient in agriculture. The agriculture production
                 in Pakistan is extremely low compared with the neighboring countries, including
                  China and India. If the withdrawal of water is continued at this rate, soon our
                  aquifers will be depleted. Therefore, we must devise proper policies at the
                   government level, keeping in view the low agricultural productivity,
                    challenges to agriculture on the ground and climate change, and, most
                    importantly, managing and conserving the vanishing water resources.`,
      },

      {
        paragraph: `Key factors affecting the water resources
      1. Clear policies at the National and Provincial levels
      Pakistan had no clear policies about its water resources until 2018, when
      Pakistan devised its first National Water Policy. It recognizes for the
       first time that water is a limited resource and that Pakistan must recover
       at least the cost of the irrigation system. Moreover, the policy also emphasizes
        assessing the potential impact of climate change on water, discussing water prices,
         and calling for regional cooperation. Besides the national water policy in 2018,
          there are some attempts made at the provincial level, including the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
          Water Policy of 2015 and Climate Change Policy of 2016, the Punjab Water Act in 2019,
          the Balochistan Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) Policy in 2006, and Sindh
          Agriculture Policy of 2018.`,
      },

      {
        paragraph: `The policies are planned too late when the country has almost exhausted 
      its water reserves. China, on the other hand, has proposed and implemented various
       measures to protect water reserves since the 1970s. Most of the policies are related
       to regulating rivers through watershed management strategies. China has constructed
        approximately 97,988 reservoirs with a total water storage capacity of over 858 billion
         cubic meters, which represents 32% of China’s surface water resources. To handle the
          rising water demand, China has established institutional measures (i.e., a soft-path strategy)
           such as water pricing, water rights, and transfers. Urban residents pay an extra
            fee of 50 to 100 percent if they exceed their monthly water allowance (He et al., 2010).`,
      },

      {
        paragraph: `Similarly, US has more than 40 federal agencies that regulate and manage
       the country’s freshwater resources. The primary water federal laws to protect the 
       water reserves of US were proposed in 1948 (the Federal Water Pollution Control Act,
         which was later amended and renamed as “Clean Water Act” in 1972) and the Safe 
         Drinking Water Act of 1974. Before the 1970s, US relied heavily on the water structures
          built for flood control, regional development, national security, and urban water supply.
          The Hoover Dam was one of the largest dams in the world when it was completed in 1936,
           with a water storage capacity of one year mean natural runoff. The California State Water
            Project, which was completed in 1973, transfers about 400 million cubic meters of
             water from northern to parts south of California State. Overall, approximately 
             85,000 dams are constructed in US, with a storage capacity of 5000 m3 per person 
             (Ho et al., 2017).

      The main concerns about national and provincial policies and water management practices
       are: Are these policies implemented? What are the guidelines for people to follow?
       Is there any awareness among the people about the water policies? Where are we
        standing compared to China and US? How much water do we conserve? How long will
        we sustain with current water management policies and strategies?`,
      },

      {
        paragraph: `2. Climate Change
      When it comes to the effects of climate change, Pakistan came to mind first.
       Pakistan ranks 8th among the countries most affected by climate change.
       The frequency, extent, and severity of extreme events due to climate change
        have significantly increased in the past few decades. Drought and floods
         are the most frequent extreme climate events that affect both available water
          resources and agriculture sectors. A few months ago, Pakistan experienced one
           of the most severe floods in history, which affected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
            Balochistan, and Sindh provinces. Detailed information about the 2022 flood is
             already available on the HydroSensing website. The most worrying thing is
              climate change in Pakistan is now a local phenomenon, not a regional one.
               For instance, the entire country faced severe floods while the Mangla dam
               reservoir was not filled to its total capacity. Therefore, in order to investigate
               the impact of climate change, we must study the climate variations at the local scale
                or events at the catchment scale.`,
      },

      {
        paragraph: `As I mentioned earlier, the impact of climate in Pakistan is extremely local,
       and we must pay attention to it. A few months ago, Pakistan received more than 150% of normal 
       precipitation in July (https://hydrosensing4u.com/2022/07/31/climate-change-and-extreme-events/) 
       and resulted in severe flood (https://hydrosensing4u.com/2022/08/26/flash-flood-in-pakistan/).
        However, in October and December, the country experienced precipitation departure of <-100% 
        (shown in Figure below) as compared to August and September. In October, the experienced 
        precipitation departure in Pakistan (overall), Gilgit, Azad, and Jammu Kashmir,
         Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Punjab, and Sindh was -50%, -57%, -25%, -39%, -84%,
          -36% and -100%, respectively.

      Besides that, the environment also has a significant impact on water resources.
       Rahman et al. (2022) identified key factors, including rainfall, surface water availability,
        population, and water withdrawal using tubewells, substantial contributions to water
         depletion in Punjab, Pakistan. Their results show that a 1% change in surface water
          and rainfall decreases the depth to the groundwater table by 0.64% and 0.55%,
           respectively. On the other hand, a 1% increase in population and the number
           of tubewells increase the depth of water table by 0.74% and 0.70%, respectively.
           Therefore, we must understand this phenomenon and do some research to develop
            robust policies and optimally manage water resources.`,
      },

      {
        paragraph: `3. Poor Water Management
      Due to poor water management practices and lately proposed policies, the reservoir’s
      storage capacities are significantly reducing. For instance, the figure below shows
       the comparison of water storage situations (i.e., between 2022 and 2020) in the
        largest reservoirs of Pakistan. The official record shows that 61%, 38%, and 11%
        water storage loss is observed in Chashma, Tarbela, and Mangla reservoirs, respectively.
         Overall, the country lost 27% of its water to the Arabian Sea without conserving it.
         The reason is a lack of water conservation practices, maintenance of reservoirs, poor
          water management practices, and the implementation of relevant policies.`,
      },

      {
        paragraph: `4. Other Factors
      Other factors affecting water resources in Pakistan include a rapid increase in population,
       poor water management practices, water distribution issues among the provinces, inefficient
        irrigation systems, lack of water harvesting structures, etc.
      
      Overall, it is suggested that we focus on the above-mentioned issues to manage 
      and save water reserves for future generations. Otherwise, we have to suffer
       from acute water shortage issues.

              Murree. Any development in this direction can provide a huge economic uplift to
               the less prosperous districts of Punjab and provide healthy entertainment to the
               people of Southern Punjab. It will also open multiple avenues between Baluchistan

           Pakistan is highly vulnerable to climate-induced extreme events, including both drought
            and floods. Examples of both extreme situations can be seen in recent past events,
            i.e., drought (2018–2022) and flood (2022). The agriculture production during 2018-
            2022 was extremely low, where Pakistan imported wheat and cash crops from other countries
            to meet the local demand. Similarly, the recent floods in Pakistan (July–August in 2022,
               continued) washed away major agricultural fields and/or water is inundated.

           (three times per decade in the recent past), especially in the arid and
           hyper-arid regions of Pakistan (Ahmed et al., 2016;

             severity, and duration. The severity and frequency of drought events are increasing
             around the globe, which directly affects the agriculture sector.

            on agriculture across the country level and provincial scale. SPEI is estimated
             using WALS (dynamic Weighted Average Least Square), a merged satellite dataset
              developed by Rahman et al. (2020), having spatial and temporal resolutions
              of 0.25 x 0.25 and 1-day, respectively. The temperature data was acquired
               from Pakistan Meteorology Department (PMD), which is not continuous.
                Therefore, the temperature data is interpolated across Pakistan using
                “topographically and climatically informed interpolation (TCII)”
                 that augments the effects of topography and climate at the same time.
                  SPEI is estimated at the high spatial resolution, where
                  both temperature (interpolated) and precipitation (WALS) data are available
                  at 0.25 x 0.25 and 1-day resolutions from 2000 to 2020.`,

        paragraph: `To analyze the impact of drought on agriculture, several variables, including maize,
           wheat, rice, sugarcane, and tobacco yields, are regressed against the SPEI. Besides,
            the impact of drought on irrigation area under canal, irrigation area under wells,
             irrigation area under tube wells, total cultivated area, and the total cropped area
              is also analyzed.`,
      },
      {
        paragraph: `The concluding remarks from this study are listed below:

          The impact of climate change is extremely variable and a local scale phenomenon,
           making it more complex to conclude general remarks.
          Karak and D.I. Khan are the most vulnerable districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
           followed by Peshawar, Bannu, Kurram, and Khyber districts.
          Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Multan, Rahim Yar Khan, Muzaffargarh, Layyah, and Lahore 
          are highly impacted districts in Punjab province.
          Sindh and Balochistan provinces are highly vulnerable to drought. For instance, 
          Gawadar, Chagai, Qilla Abdullah, Kharan, Pishin, and Pajgur in Balochistan, while Tharparkar,
           Hyderabad, Nawabshah, Umerkot, Badin, Thatta, Sukkur, Jacobabad, Mirpurkhas, and Matiari districts in Sindh are the most vulnerable districts to drought.
          The severity of drought significantly increased in drought years after 2007.
          An increase in drought severity decreases the yield of maize, sugarcane, wheat, and tobacco
           both at national and provincial scales. However, a mixed trend is observed for rice yield.
          Water availability is for irrigation, and total cropped areas are also subjected to 
          drought severity. The study recommended that the government should increase the cultivation 
          of drought-resistant species and educate farmers about climate-induced changes to cope with 
          such disasters. To cope with drought mitigation strategies, there is a need to build 
          resilience at the provincial level.
          
          The limitation of this study is the application of SPEI as representative drought,
           which does not consider soil moisture. Soil moisture is the true indicator of
            agricultural drought; therefore, the development of more representative drought 
            indices is required to analyze the impact of drought in agriculture critically.
          
          The HydroSensing team (especially the Tsinghua University team) is currently
          focusing on the development of dynamic (considering both spatial and temporal changes)
           and robust drought indices that can be used in arid and hyper-arid regions around
            the globe to monitor agricultural drought. This contribution will help us
            to understand the drought impact at a local scale, which will help
            governments and researchers to develop strategies to cope with drought.`,

        paragraph: `Factors contributing to the frequent occurrence of forest fire events
          The factors and causes of extensive and frequent fire events can be divided
          into the following four broad perspectives:`,
      },
      {
        paragraph: `Forest Management:`,
      },
      {
        paragraph: `Forest management, such as the accumulation of biomass both in abandoned pasture and 
          forest floor, is one of the major contributing factors in forest fire events,
           particularly in the spread of forest fire (FAO, 2005). Incompetent forest management
            plans, especially fuel (biomass) management, is the leading factor (FAO, 2007).
            As seen in the case of Pakistan, the government planted a billion trees in the
            Billion Tree Tsunami Project (BTTP), but the forests were not well managed.
            This might be linked to several factors, including proper funding to the
             forest department and lack of institutional structure. Furthermore,
             tourism activities, people shifting to rural areas, smuggling of timber,
              land use changes due to ownership rights, and lack of national forest
               institutional structure also contribute to poor forest management.`,
      },
      {
        paragraph: `Extreme Events/Climate Change:`,
      },
      {
        paragraph: `This factor is already discussed in the previous blog by taking the example 
        of forest fire events in Margalla Hills, Islamabad. Environment rarely causes the ignition
         of the forest but instead plays a catalytic role, as the fire spreads more easily during
         dry and hot weather. Therefore, the climate is an important factor affecting forest
          fire in regions characterized by lengthy summer with no distinct rainy events and
           temperatures above 30 ºC. As shown by several studies, climate change has resulted
            in a significant increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation in Pakistan.
             Therefore, forest fire events are expected to increase in the future.`,
      },
      {
        paragraph: `Planning and Regulations:`,
      },
      {
        paragraph: `Generally, inappropriate land use plans are proposed that do not consider the
         environment and local climate characteristics, for instance, aspects associated with natural
          fire occurrence in vegetation/forest. The plans have usually favored planting monoculture
           plants/trees, e.g., pine, which is more susceptible to fire. Plans should be devised
            appropriately by considering the opinion of forest specialists, and fire-resistant
            trees should be planted along with other trees.`,
      },
      {
        paragraph: `Inadequate Response or Lck of Capacity:`,
      },

      {
        paragraph: `Lack of capacity and/or inadequate response is the most important reason behind
        uncontrolled forest fire events. Other reasons in this category include poor monitoring,
        an inappropriate scheme for fire prevention, and a lack of rapid response units to
         reach the place of incident on time. Pakistan is among the countries lacking reliable
          monitoring and fire forecasting systems, which is essential for early response to the event.
           The responsible organizations have no access to high-resolution satellite imageries
            that could be beneficial for assessing the magnitude/extent of forest fire
            and for firefighters to find the exact location of blazes more effectively. Besides,
             the forest guards and firefighter units are usually poorly equipped and ill-trained.
             Overall, the lack of statistics and information about forest fire events and their
              causes is a major obstacle to effective forest management strategies.`,
      },
      {
        paragraph: `Impact of Wild/Forest Fire Events:`,
      },

      {
        paragraph: `Forest fire events are mostly linked with climate change and global warming,
         i.e., increase in temperature, decrease in precipitation, and consequently soil moisture 
         (as discussed in the previous blog). The burning of forests causes greenhouse gas 
         emissions and pollutes the environment, which has several consequences on the environment, 
         soil, and human health. Therefore, devising plans to mitigate forest fire events
          is extremely critical to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas and slow down global warming.

        The main problems caused by forests to the environment include soil losses at a larger scale,
         water quality and soil deterioration. Several studies reported that an increase in forest
          fire events or persisting wildfires has major consequences not limited to a decrease
           in soil fertility and an increase in the likelihood of runoff (Pereira et al., 2004).
            Forest fire also impacts the regional climate, which may result in a further rise
            in temperature, reduced rainfall, and an increase in summer. Other consequences
             include loss of timber/non-timber products, carbon sinks, loss in recreational
             activities, and exposure of biodiversity and aquifers/soils deterioration.`,
      },
      {
        paragraph: `Concluding Remarks:`,
      },

      {
        paragraph: `In concluding remarks, climate change can be considered the second most important
         factor contributing to forest fire events, ranked after human-induced events/incidents.
         The lack of information and appropriate knowledge, funding, and resources is recognized
         as the major contributing factor to poor forest management and inadequate response to
          forest fires. Besides, the professionals (firemen) are not well trained to tackle
           such situations, where is situation worsens in the areas of limited accessibility.
           The coordination between different departments should be made strong.`,
      },
      {
        paragraph: `Forest management plans should be improved, particularly the techniques used 
        to prevent fire. Usually, the forest management strategies are considered effective in
         controlling forest fire events; therefore, policymakers are now recommending to
          increase the funding for fire prevention, not for fire suppression. However,
          at the same time, there is a need to keep the information retrieval more
          easily accessible to different organizations to identify the fire event sites
           and control the fire on time.`,

          wind, and underbrush that spread over acres of land and take away everything in
          their path. Forest fire events are increasing with time mainly linked to severe
          climate changes and human-related activities. For instance, 72400 wildfire events
           in the United States of America (USA) have cleared approximately 7 million acres
           of land since 2000. There are a number of reasons for wildfires, including humans,
           nature, and climate change. I will focus on the role of climate change in wildfires

              a large number of fire events in recent decades. The average fire events of 2674
               per year are recorded in Yunnan from 1951 to 2000, which burned 111.85 million km2/year.`,

           fire events that burned around 40% of the pine trees. The Margalla Hills in Islamabad
           and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province have also experienced several forest fires in the
           last few months. The forest fire in Margalla Hills has scorched around 45 acres of land
           in 2022. The number of fire events in Margalla Hills is 33 (2018), 17 (2017), 23 (2015),
            and 36 (2014) that burned approximately 21.90%, 21.14%, 20.62%, and 19.78% of the forest
             area. The global forest watch reported 8382 fire events from 1st April to 1st July,
             of which 912 events are high confidence and around 1351 mild fire events.
             On the contrary, the fire events from April 1st to July 1st in 2021 were 975,
             out of which 81 were high confidence, and 399 were mild fire events. The forest
             fire events are approximately 8.5 folds more in 2022 compared to 2021.
             The recorded high confidence and mild fire alerts are 11 and 3.4 times higher in 2022.
              The question is, ” Why did the forest fire events significantly increase in one year?”.
               There might be one answer, climate change.`,

        paragraph: `The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCD) has recently declared
           2020-2022 a severe drought period in Pakistan. The temperature has an increasing trend
            while rainfall has decreased over the last few years. The increase in temperature results
            in the increase of Evapotranspiration (ET) and hence a decrease in soil moisture.
             The decreased soil moisture left the vegetation dry, which is more vulnerable to
             climate-induced fire events. Therefore, the dry vegetation becomes fuel in such an
             extended severe drought event accompanied by an increase in temperature and a decrease
             in rainfall/soil moisture. There are two ways that climate change can influence forest fire.
              First, it increases the likelihood of forest fire and second, it may result in prolonged
               forest fire events due to increased temperature.`,
